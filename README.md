# AI/ML Engineering Internship Projects

This repository contains multiple hands-on AI/ML projects completed as part of an AI/ML Engineering Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation.

## Projects Overview

### Task 1: BERT News Classifier
- NLP-based text classification using a pretrained BERT model
- Focus on tokenization, fine-tuning, and evaluation

### Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction
- End-to-end ML pipeline
- Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

### Task 3: Multimodal Housing Price Prediction
- Combines image data and tabular features
- CNN-based feature extraction + regression

### Task 4: Context-Aware Chatbot (RAG)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LangChain and FAISS
- Answers queries using external documents

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain
- FAISS

## How to Use
Each task contains its own README with setup instructions and explanations.
